README for Auth-Friends

This project utilizes Axios authorization to assign and record friends added to the friends list in the project. 
The POST requests found in the handleSubmit in the FriendsForm file assigns a new friend to the list. When the event is triggered in the handle submit,
a new friend is added. 
Each new friend has a name, age and email assigned to them.
Each item connects to the handleSubmit so they can be added to the newFriend data set upon triggeing the event handler. 
This makes it possible to validate a user before allowing them access to data within an app.

The purpose of this project is to show an understanding of form validation and handling state. It also displays an understanding of
event handlers as a means of submitting form data.
